# Testing Vanilla JS Accessible Tabs

The shell of this app comes from [thawkin3](https://github.com/thawkin3/dom-testing-demo). Please give check out their app and give it a star. I found this example on [Medium](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-unit-test-html-and-vanilla-javascript-without-a-ui-framework-c4c89c9f5e56?source=friends_link&sk=15836e19406fd422a13411e3ef497c0d).

I wanted to write tests from previous examples in the book that I wrote with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.
